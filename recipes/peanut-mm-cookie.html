        <h2>An interesting cookie recipe for when you have nothing to cook</h2>
            <p>Unlike most cookie recipes, this one <em>doesn't use</em> peanut butter directly,
            which make somewhat different. <br> As such if you want to try new ways of preparing 
            cookies, you might as well begin by trying this.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 cup of powdered peanut butter (such as PB2 idk, I took it directly from all recipes)</li>
                <li>1/4 cup of sugar</li>
                <li>2 1/2 tablespoons of unsalted softened butter</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>1 pinch of salt</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon of peanut butter flavor</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon of baking powder</li>
                <li>1/4 cup of mini candy-coated milk chocolates (such as <strike>Skittles</strike> M&M's)</li>
            </ul>
